# GameFrame Converter

I used it as an exercise to pick up some Rust and convert the
files from a Gameframe (a directory of bitmaps and a config.ini
file) to a gif.


# Usage

Using nix, with flakes enabled, it's just a `nix run github:cransom/gameframe-converter -- <path to directory>`. Otherwise, rust/cargo
steps apply.
